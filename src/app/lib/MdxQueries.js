The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\n\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\" alt=\"Illustrated map of the Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. \" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\n\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business.

The first reason being that it was not heavy enough.

The Forward Thrust pools were supposed to be built adjacent to local high schools so that they could be used for practice, but property values in Queen Anne were very high. A compromise was made, and it was decided that the pool should be built next to McClure Middle School instead.\n\nEven after it was built, incidents delayed the pool - the humidity turned the exposed bricks white, and the thermometer controlling the pool’s temperature broke, which raised the water to a balmy 100 degrees.\n\nThe exterior of the pool was design to match the neighboring middle school, but McAdoo’s modernist touch can be best seen from the interior with its exposed brick, concrete, and wood. \n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/mcAdoo/article.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn92051342/1947-03-08/ed-1/?sp=11&q=benjamin+mcadoo&r=-0.171,-0.054,1.084,0.743,0\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\"/>\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/mcAdoo/tips.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn92051342/1947-03-08/ed-1/?sp=11&q=benjamin+mcadoo&r=-0.171,-0.054,1.084,0.743,0\" caption=\"Article from the Hartford Chronicle, an African-American newspaper based in Connecticut, about what it takes to become a architect.

The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\" alt=\"Illustrated map of the Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. \" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\n\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business.

It was decided that along with carving out the canal and building the locks, four drawbridges should also be constructed to keep the city tied together: the Ballard Bridge, Fremont Bridge, University Bridge, and Montlake Bridge.\n\n\n<ComicSection rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\n    {type:'text', position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}, style:{outline:\"box\", fontSize:\"1rem\", backgroundColor:\"white\"}, src:\"The bridge is double-leaf, which means the road divides into two parts when lifted.\"},]}/>\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/doubleLeaf.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0441.sheet/?sp=1&st=image\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\"/>\n<ComicSection rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\n    {type:'text', position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}, style:{outline:\"box\", fontSize:\"1rem\", backgroundColor:\"white\"}, src:\"It is also a bascule bridge, which is French for balance - to save energy, the weight of the road-half is perfect balanced on the other side with a counterweight.\"},]}/>\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/bascule.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0441.sheet/?sp=3&st=image\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\"/>\n\n<ComicSection rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\n    {type:'text', position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}, style:{outline:\"box\", fontSize:\"1rem\", backgroundColor:\"white\"}, src:\"The Montlake Bridge also uses trunnions, which is the pivot point that the leaves and counterweight rotate around.\"},]}/>\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/trunnion.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0441.sheet/?sp=2&st=image\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\"/>\n\nThey were inspired by similar bridges in Chicago, designed to cross the Chicago River.\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/chicagoBridge.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/stereo.1s12313/\" caption=\"Michigan Avenue Bridge over Chicago River\" alt=\"stereograph of bridge opening up for a boat to pass under\"/>\n\nThe first bascule bridge that was completed was the Fremont Bridge in 1917, and an article about it was published in Engineering News-Record. Folks at the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company, the firm that had created the trunnion bascule bridge design, saw the article, and in 1920, they sued the city of Seattle for $348,000.\n\nThe Montlake Bridge was vastly delayed, being the last of the four bridges to be constructed, as the city revised its plans to avoid further litigation. \n\n<ComicSection elements={[\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/protestors.png\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:4}},\n    {type: \"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"I want to see football!!!!\", position:{col:3, row:3}, size:{width:1, height:1}}\n]}/>\n\n\nThus, of all the bascule bridges in the entire city of Seattle, the Montlake Bridge is unique in that the trunnions, the pivot points on which the roads of the bridge turn, sit on top of concrete blocks instead of on steel cross girders. This change was meant to make the bridge different enough from the Strauss design that Strauss wouldn't sue again (they did anyway, in 1925, though they were unable to stop construction).\n\nIf you want to learn more about the bridge's history and how it works, you can read the full engineering report here, which states: “Only in America could football become a justification for building a bridge.”\n\n<BigLink link=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/master/pnp/habshaer/wa/wa0400/wa0441/data/wa0441data.pdf\" thumbnail=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" title=\"Montlake Bridge HAER Report\"/>\n\n{/* \nSticker template: \n{image: \"\", linkOut: \"\"}\n*/}\n\n{/* <ComicSection elements={[\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}, style:{outline: \"bubble\"}, bubbleStyle: {tailDegree: 0}},\n\n]}/>  */}\n","title":"The most unique bridge in Seattle","locationTitle":"Montlake Bridge","address":"Montlake Blvd E","location":["Seattle"],"latlon":[47.64740913305527,-122.30456014763188],"neighborhood":"Montlake","zoom":15,"tags":["built"],"cameraImage":"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/doubleLeaf.png","cardImage":"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/bascule.png","stampName":null,"photoPrompt":"You can walk over and under the bridge.

Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing.

However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\n\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them. Now, none of the original named trees stand in Ravenna Park today. \n\nMost future trees are now protected by <a href=\"https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.11TRPR_25.11.050GEPRRETRCA\">Seattle Municipal code</a>, which characterizes trees based on their size, species, age, and heritage.

The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\n\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\" alt=\"Illustrated map of the Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. \" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\n\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business.

Sitting on the saltwater sound and with no fresh water sources nearby, Ballard relied on the city of Seattle to provide them with safe drinking water. And although it was the second-largest town in King County, in 1907, Ballard became a part of the larger town.\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/ballard.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn87093407/1907-02-06/ed-1/?sp=1&q=ballard+annexation&r=0.604,0.48,0.518,0.358,0\" caption=\"Citizens of Ballard were not happy with the decision. On the day they merged, the flag was flown at half mast.\"/>\n\nIn 1910, Seattle replaced the wooden fire station with the red brick building that still stands today. The architects for the new structure were Bebb & Mendel, who also designed the University Heights Elementary School and the Oriental Building in Downtown Seattle. Bebb later went on to design the Seattle Asian Art Museum (known at the time as the Art Institute of Seattle).\n\nAt the time, fire engines were powered by horses, so the area at the back of the station contained horse stalls.\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/firehorse.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3a27542/\" caption=\"Horse-drawn fire engine rushing to a fire\" alt=\"Photograph shows three white horses rushing down city street pulling a steam fire engine carrying three fire fighters\"/>\n<ComicSection elements={[\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/station.png\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:3}},\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"box\", backgroundColor:\"white\", fontSize:\"1rem\"}, src:\"The front the station has four bay doors.\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}},\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"box\", backgroundColor:\"white\", fontSize:\"2rem\"}, src:\"Perfect for a team of horses on their way to work!\", position:{col:1, row:5}, size:{width:3, height:1}},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/horses.png\", position:{col:1, row:4}, size:{width:3, height:7}},\n    ]}/>\n\nAt times, extra support was needed to handle some fires. In 1958, the Seattle Cedar Mill had a catastrophic fire. Located right next to the Ballard Bridge on the Lake Washington Ship Canal, the mill would process logs into boards, and then store them to have them dry for months before being sold.\n\n<ComicSection cols={5} elements={[\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"Those stacks of wood are over 50 feet high!\", position:{col:2, row:1}, size:{width:2, height:1}},\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"It’d be really bad if a fire started here... all of the wood is so.... flammable.\", position:{col:3, row:2}, size:{width:3, height:1}},\n     {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/mill.png\", position:{col:1, row:2}, size:{width:5, height:5}},\n     {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/firestationNo18/concernHorse.png\", position:{col:4, row:4}, size:{width:2, height:2}},\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"It probably would take at least 3 days to put out...\", position:{col:1, row:5}, size:{width:2, height:1}},\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"And require a fireboat....\", position:{col:3, row:6}, size:{width:1, height:1}},\n]}/>\n\nLuckily, Seattle had the Fireboat Duwamish as part of its firefighting fleet.

It was the last to be built of the seven Forward Thrust pools, and its first challenge was finding a location. The Forward Thrust pools were supposed to be built adjacent to local high schools so that they could be used for practice, but property values in Queen Anne were very high. A compromise was made, and it was decided that the pool should be built next to McClure Middle School instead.\n\nEven after it was built, incidents delayed the pool - the humidity turned the exposed bricks white, and the thermometer controlling the pool’s temperature broke, which raised the water to a balmy 100 degrees.\n\nThe exterior of the pool was design to match the neighboring middle school, but McAdoo’s modernist touch can be best seen from the interior with its exposed brick, concrete, and wood. \n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/mcAdoo/article.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn92051342/1947-03-08/ed-1/?sp=11&q=benjamin+mcadoo&r=-0.171,-0.054,1.084,0.743,0\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\"/>\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/mcAdoo/tips.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn92051342/1947-03-08/ed-1/?sp=11&q=benjamin+mcadoo&r=-0.171,-0.054,1.084,0.743,0\" caption=\"Article from the Hartford Chronicle, an African-American newspaper based in Connecticut, about what it takes to become a architect.

Seattle applied for the federal grant to create better infrastructure for its International District, Pioneer Square, and Central Area neighborhoods.\n\nBuilt in the historically Black neighborhood of the Central Area, it was through a community petition that the pool be named in memory of Evers, who had been assassinated only a few years earlier in Mississippi.\n\nAt the time, Seattle was also examining its own discriminatory practices. In the wake of MLK’s assassination, Seattle passed Ordinance 96619 to prohibit covenants and sundown zones in the city. \n\nSeattle has a large Black community, with three large migrations of folks coming to the city in hopes of a good life. This dream was heavily championed by Horace R. Cayton Sr., a journalist and eventual creator of the Seattle Republican, which, of Seattle’s seven African American newspapers, was the most successful and was published from 1894 until 1915.\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/medgarEversPool/seattleRepNews.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn84025811/1903-04-17/ed-1/?sp=6&st=image&r=-0.107,-0.101,1.131,0.801,0\"/>\n\nThe Seattle Republican had national spread, having Pullman Porters distribute papers on their train runs from the west coast to the east.\n\n<BigLink link=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/picturethis/2015/02/pictures-to-go-sleeping-car-quarters-and-sleeping-car-porters/\" thumbnail=\"/loc/seattle/medgarEversPool/porter.jpg\" title=\"Sleeping Car Quarters and Sleeping Car Porters\"/>\n\n <ComicSection elements={[\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/medgarEversPool/cayton1.png\", position:{col:3, row:2}, size:{width:1, height:2}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"Horace Cayton Sr, creator of The Seattle Republican\", position:{col:3, row:3},style:{backgroundColor:\"white\",border:'none', fontSize:\".7rem\"}, size:{width: 1, height:1}},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/medgarEversPool/cayton2.png\", position:{col:3, row:4}, size:{width:1, height:2}},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/medgarEversPool/cayton3.png\", position:{col:3, row:6}, size:{width:1, height:2}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"Come to Seattle!

The Seattle Republican eventually shut down when Cayton lost a lawsuit he against a restaurant that refused future service to him.\n\nBut as time went on, and as many of the Chinese and Indigenous people were driven out of Seattle, more hatred was directed towards Seattle’s Black community. For example, though not written in law, some practices systematically blocked people of color from purchasing homes in specific neighborhoods.\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" showSave={false}/>\n\nWith the new pool being built in Seattle’s Central District, the community petitioned to name it after Medgar Evers. In a document, they wrote of him:\n\n“He became a hero, not because he died, but because he learned to live with the mounting probability of violent death and refused to turn aside. Because his life so symbolized the struggle of a whole people to be free, he was shot in the back.”\n\nYou can read more about Medgar Evers' life here:\n\n<BigLink link=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2021/07/medgar-evers-a-hero-in-life-and-death/\" thumbnail=\"/loc/seattle/medgarEversPool/statue.jpg\" title=\"Medgar Evers: A Hero in Life and Death\"/>\n",

The route that was eventually chosen was the North Canal cut from Shilshole Bay, despite being the longest at 16.9 miles.\n\nWith a new waterway, there was also a new problem - the city was now divided in half. It was decided that along with carving out the canal and building the locks, four drawbridges should also be constructed to keep the city tied together: the Ballard Bridge, Fremont Bridge, University Bridge, and Montlake Bridge.\n\n\n<ComicSection rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\n    {type:'text', position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}, style:{outline:\"box\", fontSize:\"1rem\", backgroundColor:\"white\"}, src:\"The bridge is double-leaf, which means the road divides into two parts when lifted.\"},]}/>\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/doubleLeaf.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0441.sheet/?sp=1&st=image\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\"/>\n<ComicSection rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\n    {type:'text', position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}, style:{outline:\"box\", fontSize:\"1rem\", backgroundColor:\"white\"}, src:\"It is also a bascule bridge, which is French for balance - to save energy, the weight of the road-half is perfect balanced on the other side with a counterweight.\"},]}/>\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/bascule.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0441.sheet/?sp=3&st=image\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\"/>\n\n<ComicSection rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\n    {type:'text', position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:1}, style:{outline:\"box\", fontSize:\"1rem\", backgroundColor:\"white\"}, src:\"The Montlake Bridge also uses trunnions, which is the pivot point that the leaves and counterweight rotate around.\"},]}/>\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/trunnion.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0441.sheet/?sp=2&st=image\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\"/>\n\nThey were inspired by similar bridges in Chicago, designed to cross the Chicago River.\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/chicagoBridge.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/stereo.1s12313/\" caption=\"Michigan Avenue Bridge over Chicago River\" alt=\"stereograph of bridge opening up for a boat to pass under\"/>\n\nThe first bascule bridge that was completed was the Fremont Bridge in 1917, and an article about it was published in Engineering News-Record. Folks at the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company, the firm that had created the trunnion bascule bridge design, saw the article, and in 1920, they sued the city of Seattle for $348,000.\n\nThe Montlake Bridge was vastly delayed, being the last of the four bridges to be constructed, as the city revised its plans to avoid further litigation. \n\n<ComicSection elements={[\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/protestors.png\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:4}},\n    {type: \"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"I want to see football!!!!\", position:{col:3, row:3}, size:{width:1, height:1}}\n]}/>\n\n\nThus, of all the bascule bridges in the entire city of Seattle, the Montlake Bridge is unique in that the trunnions, the pivot points on which the roads of the bridge turn, sit on top of concrete blocks instead of on steel cross girders. This change was meant to make the bridge different enough from the Strauss design that Strauss wouldn't sue again (they did anyway, in 1925, though they were unable to stop construction).\n\nIf you want to learn more about the bridge's history and how it works, you can read the full engineering report here, which states: “Only in America could football become a justification for building a bridge.”\n\n<BigLink link=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/master/pnp/habshaer/wa/wa0400/wa0441/data/wa0441data.pdf\" thumbnail=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" title=\"Montlake Bridge HAER Report\"/>\n\n{/* \nSticker template: \n{image: \"\", linkOut: \"\"}\n*/}\n\n{/* <ComicSection elements={[\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}, style:{outline: \"bubble\"}, bubbleStyle: {tailDegree: 0}},\n\n]}/>  */}\n",

It uses a chemical process that exposes light on a plate coated in silver. Bell was an accomplished daguerreotypist, opening studios across the country, and eventually settling in Seattle.\n\nAlice Ball was born in 1892 in Seattle, WA into a family of photographers - John Presley Ball was her grandfather - and, perhaps inspired by the photography process, she studied chemistry at the University of Washington.\n\nShe then got her master’s in chemistry at the University of Hawai’i, where her thesis explored the chemical makeup of a plant that could be used to treat many illnesses, from anxiety to kidney disorders. She was both the first woman and the first African American to get a master’s from UH.\n\n<ComicSection cols={5} rowHeight=\"2rem\" elements={[\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"When I saw Alice Ball’s work, I thought she’d be the perfect person to work on researching chaulmoogra oil, which also was extracted from a plant.\",style:{outline: \"bubble\"}, position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:5, height:3}},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/aliceBall/tree.png\", position:{col:2, row:3}, size:{width:3, height:7}},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/aliceBall/hollmann1.png\", position:{col:4, row:5}, size:{width:2, height:5}},\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline: \"bubble\"}, position:{col:1, row:8}, size:{width:3, height:3},src:\"Using this oil as treatment was the most effective way to treat leprosy, and it had been a method since the 1300s, ...\"},\n    {type:\"text\",style:{outline: \"bubble\"}, position:{col:4, row:10}, size:{width:2, height:2}, src:\"but there was no good way to administer it to patients.\"},\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline: \"box\"},position:{col:1, row:13}, size:{width:2, height:2},src:\"It was too sticky to be applied to skin directly\"},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/aliceBall/sticky.png\", position:{col:1, row:14}, size:{width:2, height:5}},{type:\"text\", style:{outline: \"box\"},position:{col:4, row:13}, size:{width:2, height:2},src:\"If we gave it via injection, their skin would react with rows and rows of blisters\"},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/aliceBall/bumps.png\", position:{col:4, row:14}, size:{width:2, height:5}},\n\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline: \"bubble\"},position:{col:3, row:20}, size:{width:2, height:2},src:\"And if people injested it...\"},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/aliceBall/injest1.png\", position:{col:2, row:21}, size:{width:1, height:5}},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/aliceBall/hollmann2.png\", position:{col:4, row:22}, size:{width:2, height:4}},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/aliceBall/injest2.png\", position:{col:2, row:27}, size:{width:1, height:5}},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/aliceBall/hollmann3.png\", position:{col:4, row:28}, size:{width:2, height:4}},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/aliceBall/injest3.png\", position:{col:1, row:36}, size:{width:2, height:5}},\n    {type:\"text\", style:{outline: \"bubble\"},position:{col:4, row:34}, size:{width:2, height:2},src:\"well, it wouldn't stay down\"},\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/aliceBall/hollmann4.png\", position:{col:4, row:36}, size:{width:2, height:5}},\n]}/> \nSo even though there had a medicine to treat leprosy for centuries, there was no way to give it to patients.

The Olmsted firm, who designed Central Park in New York, designed many of Seattle’s most iconic parks, including Volunteer Park, Seward Park, Woodland Park, and the Arboretum.\n\nWhen the Olmsted firm was making its grand plan for the city, they also did a review of Ravenna Park, which at the time was privately owned by William and Louise Beck.\n\n<Comic position=\"full\" image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree1.png\"/>\n\nRavenna Park was notable for two things:\n\n- Its deep ravine, which was formed by the Vashon Glacier and was fed by other lakes that were glacier carved as well, including Bitter Lake, Green Lake, and Haller Lake.\n- Its large, large, LARGE trees, who avoided being cut down by loggers.\n\nJohn Charles Olmsted recommended that Ravenna Park be bought by the city for these two reasons, and stated that the forest was better preserved than any other portion of the city. \n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree2.png\" caption=\"Louise Beck\" position=\"right\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"These trees are beautiful giants who deserve beautiful names. \"},{text:\"I’ll name this one Paderewski, because I think these royal trees would certainly appreciate classical music.\"}, {text:\" Plus Jan Paderewski is going to play a recital in Seattle next week. \"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree3.png\" position=\"center\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"and this one should be called Roosevelt, because it is awesome, just like our president.\"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree4.png\" position=\"left\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"I’ll call this one Adam.

Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing. Roosevelt, the so-called Largest Fir Tree in the State, was the first to be cut down, which alarmed many people.\n\nWilliam Beck tried to investigate: the Parks Board said that the trees were rotted and a danger. However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\n\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them. Now, none of the original named trees stand in Ravenna Park today. \n\nMost future trees are now protected by <a href=\"https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.11TRPR_25.11.050GEPRRETRCA\">Seattle Municipal code</a>, which characterizes trees based on their size, species, age, and heritage. But the *Roosevelt* tree would still not be protected, since tree removals by the Parks department are not watched under this code and just rely on the departments policy.\n{/* <Comic image=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" position=\"left\" speechBubbles={[{}]}/>*/}\n",

The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\n\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\" alt=\"Illustrated map of the Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. \" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\n\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business.

The first reason being that it was not heavy enough. The building was estimated to be over 400,000 pounds, and so it was placed on 28 dollies to spread the work around.\n\n<ComicSection cols={8} rowHeight=\"2rem\" elements={[\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/wheelGang.png\", position:{col:1, row:4}, size:{width:8, height:6}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"Alright, team!!

The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\n\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\" alt=\"Illustrated map of the Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. \" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\n\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business.

In the wake of MLK’s assassination, Seattle passed Ordinance 96619 to prohibit covenants and sundown zones in the city. \n\nSeattle has a large Black community, with three large migrations of folks coming to the city in hopes of a good life.

The route that was eventually chosen was the North Canal cut from Shilshole Bay, despite being the longest at 16.9 miles.\n\nWith a new waterway, there was also a new problem - the city was now divided in half.

Folks at the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company, the firm that had created the trunnion bascule bridge design, saw the article, and in 1920, they sued the city of Seattle for $348,000.\n\nThe Montlake Bridge was vastly delayed, being the last of the four bridges to be constructed, as the city revised its plans to avoid further litigation. \n\n<ComicSection elements={[\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/protestors.png\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:4}},\n    {type: \"text\", style:{outline:\"bubble\"}, src:\"I want to see football!!!!\", position:{col:3, row:3}, size:{width:1, height:1}}\n]}/>\n\n\nThus, of all the bascule bridges in the entire city of Seattle, the Montlake Bridge is unique in that the trunnions, the pivot points on which the roads of the bridge turn, sit on top of concrete blocks instead of on steel cross girders. This change was meant to make the bridge different enough from the Strauss design that Strauss wouldn't sue again (they did anyway, in 1925, though they were unable to stop construction).\n\nIf you want to learn more about the bridge's history and how it works, you can read the full engineering report here, which states: “Only in America could football become a justification for building a bridge.”\n\n<BigLink link=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/master/pnp/habshaer/wa/wa0400/wa0441/data/wa0441data.pdf\" thumbnail=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" title=\"Montlake Bridge HAER Report\"/>\n\n{/* \nSticker template: \n{image: \"\", linkOut: \"\"}\n*/}\n\n{/* <ComicSection elements={[\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}, style:{outline: \"bubble\"}, bubbleStyle: {tailDegree: 0}},\n\n]}/>  */}\n","title":"The most unique bridge in Seattle","locationTitle":"Montlake Bridge","address":"Montlake Blvd E","location":["Seattle"],"latlon":[47.64740913305527,-122.30456014763188],"neighborhood":"Montlake","zoom":15,"tags":["built"],"cameraImage":"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/doubleLeaf.png","cardImage":"/loc/seattle/montlakeBridge/bascule.png","stampName":null,"photoPrompt":"You can walk over and under the bridge.

Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing.

However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\n\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them.

    "content": "\nEsther Hobart Morris was a woman built to be a legend and so she became one. She stood at a striking six feet tall and 180 pounds and always wore the latest fashions because she knew people would always be watching her.\n\nShe was the first woman to hold public office in the United States as justice of the peace in South Pass City, Wyoming despite not having a law degree or any formal education. In her courtroom, she and her sons said it was “Justice first, then after that the law.”\n\nSouth Pass City was the largest city along the Oregon Trail. By 1869, the year Morris arrived in South Pass City, over 400,000 people had crossed Wyoming. Mark Twain wrote about his visit to the stage station in his book “Roughing It”:\n\n[LC ITEM: Roughing It.]\n[LC ITEM: South Pass City]\n\nIt wasn’t easy being the first female judge for Morris starting from day one. Her predecessor, J. W. Stillman, refused to turn his court dockets over to a woman.\n\n[COMIC]\nI won’t do it!\nYeah that’s gonna be a warrant then\n\nIn his first court appearance, Stillman’s attorney argued that the warrant was improperly issued\n[COMIC] Esther is looking @ the document\n.....okay I see where you’re coming from. Case dismissed\n-- they’re celebrating\nShe just writes another one\n\nIn his second court appearance, Stillman argued that it wouldn’t be a fair trial with her presiding \n[COMIC] -- she looks at her two sons. her husband is mad she’s a judge\nokay I see where you’re coming from. Case dismissed\nhahahah you’ll never get these court cases from me!\n-- she looks at em. they’re messy. doesn’t want ehtme anyways\nTells her sons to go buy her a new record book\n\nEven though she lost her first court case, she won in the court of public opinion. People thought her decisions were fair, and she prioritized clearly communicating her reasoning over using fancy legal speak.\n\nLess than a year after her initial appointment, Morris’s term came to an end, and she left South Pass City. She followed her son to Laramie, and eventually settled in Cheyenne. Two nine-feet tall statues exist to celebrate her legacy -- one stands in the State Capitol in Cheyenne, and other stands in the US Capitol in Washington DC.",

Knight was a professor of geology at the University of Wyoming, and his name is attached to so many things -- the geology building itself, the science camp named after his honor in the Medicine Bow Mountains, and even a fossil.\n\nDoc Knight came from a family of geologists - his father was also a professor at the university, and the state fossil of Wyoming was named after him, the Knightia, a freshwater fish that is the most commonly found fish fossil in the world.\n[LC ITEM]\n\nKnown for his exciting lectures on geology, where he could draw both detailed diagrams on the chalkboards of geologic formations and a perfect circle.\n\n[COMIC] Teaching inside.

To transport things to the camp, they got eleven Franklin cars, which they painted bright yellow with a dinosaur logo. Lecturers and students would come across the country to learn at the camp.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Classroom Building from east\" alt=\"black and white photograph of log building\" image=\"/loc/sewy/knight/classroom.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wy0048.photos/?sp=13\"/>\n\nKnight was an ardent educator - in his time, it is estimated that he taught over 13,000 students. And he was disappointed with the amount of fossils that would be extracted from Wyoming and sent out of the state -- so he acquired the Brontosaurus fossils and assembled it for the museum. After his retirement, he kept working, and taught himself metalwork to construct the lifesize T-Rex out of copper plates that sit outside the building named after him.","title":"S.H.
