The Olmsted firm, who designed Central Park in New York, designed many of Seattle’s most iconic parks, including Volunteer Park, Seward Park, Woodland Park, and the Arboretum.\n\nWhen the Olmsted firm was making its grand plan for the city, they also did a review of Ravenna Park, which at the time was privately owned by William and Louise Beck.\n\n<Comic position=\"full\" image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree1.png\"/>\n\nRavenna Park was notable for two things:\n\n- Its deep ravine, which was formed by the Vashon Glacier and was fed by other lakes that were glacier carved as well, including Bitter Lake, Green Lake, and Haller Lake.\n- Its large, large, LARGE trees, who avoided being cut down by loggers.\n\nJohn Charles Olmsted recommended that Ravenna Park be bought by the city because of these two reasons, and stated that the forest was better preserved than any other portion of the city. \n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree2.png\" caption=\"Louise Beck\" position=\"right\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"These trees are beautiful giants who deserve beautiful names. \"},{text:\"I’ll name this one Paderewski, because I think these royal trees would certainly appreciate classical music.\"}, {text:\" Plus Jan Paderewski is going to play a recital in Seattle next week. \"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree3.png\" position=\"center\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"and this one should be called Roosevelt, because it is awesome, just like our president.\"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree4.png\" position=\"left\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"I’ll call this one Adam.

Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing. Roosevelt, the so-called Largest Fir Tree in the State, was the first to be cut down, which alarmed many people.\n\nWilliam Beck tried to investigate: the Parks Board said that the trees were rotted and a danger. However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\n\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them. Now, none of the original named trees stand in Ravenna Park today. \n\nMost future trees are now protected by <a href=\"https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.11TRPR_25.11.050GEPRRETRCA\">Seattle Municipal code</a>, which characterizes trees based on their size, species, age, and heritage.

Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing. Roosevelt, the so-called Largest Fir Tree in the State, was the first to be cut down, which alarmed many people.\n\nWilliam Beck tried to investigate: the Parks Board said that the trees were rotted and a danger. However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\n\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them.

The Olmsted firm, who designed Central Park in New York, designed many of Seattle’s most iconic parks, including Volunteer Park, Seward Park, Woodland Park, and the Arboretum.\n\nWhen the Olmsted firm was making its grand plan for the city, they also did a review of Ravenna Park, which at the time was privately owned by William and Louise Beck.\n\n<Comic position=\"full\" image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree1.png\"/>\n\nRavenna Park was notable for two things:\n\n- Its deep ravine, which was formed by the Vashon Glacier and was fed by other lakes that were glacier carved as well, including Bitter Lake, Green Lake, and Haller Lake.\n- Its large, large, LARGE trees, who avoided being cut down by loggers.\n\nJohn Charles Olmsted recommended that Ravenna Park be bought by the city because of these two reasons, and stated that the forest was better preserved than any other portion of the city. \n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree2.png\" caption=\"Louise Beck\" position=\"right\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"These trees are beautiful giants who deserve beautiful names. \"},{text:\"I’ll name this one Paderewski, because I think these royal trees would certainly appreciate classical music.\"}, {text:\" Plus Jan Paderewski is going to play a recital in Seattle next week. \"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree3.png\" position=\"center\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"and this one should be called Roosevelt, because it is awesome, just like our president.\"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree4.png\" position=\"left\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"I’ll call this one Adam.

Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing. Roosevelt, the so-called Largest Fir Tree in the State, was the first to be cut down, which alarmed many people.\n\nWilliam Beck tried to investigate: the Parks Board said that the trees were rotted and a danger. However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\n\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them.

The Olmsted firm, who designed Central Park in New York, designed many of Seattle’s most iconic parks, including Volunteer Park, Seward Park, Woodland Park, and the Arboretum.\n\nWhen the Olmsted firm was making its grand plan for the city, they also did a review of Ravenna Park, which at the time was privately owned by William and Louise Beck.\n\n<Comic position=\"full\" image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree1.png\"/>\n\nRavenna Park was notable for two things:\n\n- Its deep ravine, which was formed by the Vashon Glacier and was fed by other lakes that were glacier carved as well, including Bitter Lake, Green Lake, and Haller Lake.\n- Its large, large, LARGE trees, who avoided being cut down by loggers.\n\nJohn Charles Olmsted recommended that Ravenna Park be bought by the city because of these two reasons, and stated that the forest was better preserved than any other portion of the city. \n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree2.png\" caption=\"Louise Beck\" position=\"right\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"These trees are beautiful giants who deserve beautiful names. \"},{text:\"I’ll name this one Paderewski, because I think these royal trees would certainly appreciate classical music.\"}, {text:\" Plus Jan Paderewski is going to play a recital in Seattle next week. \"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree3.png\" position=\"center\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"and this one should be called Roosevelt, because it is awesome, just like our president.\"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree4.png\" position=\"left\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"I’ll call this one Adam.

Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing. Roosevelt, the so-called Largest Fir Tree in the State, was the first to be cut down, which alarmed many people.\n\nWilliam Beck tried to investigate: the Parks Board said that the trees were rotted and a danger. However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\n\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them. Now, none of the original named trees stand in Ravenna Park today. \n\nMost future trees are now protected by <a href=\"https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.11TRPR_25.11.050GEPRRETRCA\">Seattle Municipal code</a>, which characterizes trees based on their size, species, age, and heritage. But the *Roosevelt* tree would still not be protected, since tree removals by the Parks department are not watched under this code and just rely on the departments policy.\n{/* <Comic image=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" position=\"left\" speechBubbles={[{}]}/>*/}\n",
