Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing. Roosevelt, the so-called Largest Fir Tree in the State, was the first to be cut down, which alarmed many people.\n\nWilliam Beck tried to investigate: the Parks Board said that the trees were rotted and a danger. However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\n\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them. Now, none of the original named trees stand in Ravenna Park today. \n\nMost future trees are now protected by <a href=\"https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.11TRPR_25.11.050GEPRRETRCA\">Seattle Municipal code</a>, which characterizes trees based on their size, species, age, and heritage. But the *Roosevelt* tree would still not be protected, since tree removals by the Parks department are not watched under this code and just rely on the departments policy.\n{/* <Comic image=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" position=\"left\" speechBubbles={[{}]}/>*/}\n","title":"Disappearing Trees in Ravenna Park","location":["Seattle"],"latlon":[47.67253514142577,-122.30892713366536],"zoom":14,"tags":["parks","olmsted"],"cardImage":"/placeholderThumbnail.png","stickers":[{"image":"/placeholderThumbnail.png"},{"image":"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree1.png"},{"image":"/loc/seattle/ravenna/letter2.png","linkOut":"https://www.loc.gov/resource/mss52571.mss52571-02-096_0293_0296/?sp=3&st=image&r=0.323,0.009,0.293,0.436,0"}]},{"slug":"seattleCentral","content":"\n## Seattle Central College used to be Seattle's first high school\n\n(kinda)\n\n<LOCItem linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn87093407/1923-05-17/ed-1/?sp=9&r=-0.321,0.093,1.881,1.062,0\" image=\"/loc/food-fight.jpg\"/>","title":"Seattle Central College","location":["Seattle"],"latlon":[47.616761121594315,-122.32169094779286],"zoom":13,"tags":[""],"cardImage":"/loc/food-fight.jpg","cameraType":"newspaper","frameImage":"/loc/camera-images/high-school.png","imagePlacement":[1080,808],"imageDimensions":[293,405]},{"slug":"sinking-ship","content":"\n\n# Sinking Ship\n\n<LOCItem linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/75696663/\" alt=\"crowded illustrated map of downtown Seattle\" image=\"/loc/triangle.jpg\" caption=\"Map of Seattle in 1891\"/>\n\nHere, where Yesler, 1st, and James meet, a triangle piece of land hosts a unique parking garage called the “Sinking Ship”.\n\nBefore this parking garage was built here, it was the site of three Seattle hotels: the Occidental I, the Occidental II, and the Hotel Seattle.\n\n<LOCItem linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.seattlememories00redf/?sp=21\" alt=\"photograph of a two story, medium building with a crowd outside\" image=\"/loc/occidental.png\" caption=\"Occidental Hotel\"/>\n<Comic alt=\"illustration of an old-timey man with glasses\" caption=\"Doc Maynard, believer of the 'Seattle streets should follow the compass' system\" position=\"right\" speechBubbles={[{ text: '*This* was the first \"fancy\" hotel in Seattle.' }]} image=\"/comics/sinking-ship/g1.png\" overlap={150} absoluteHeight={200}/>\n<LOCItem linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.metropolitanseat00unse/?sp=19&r=-0.073,0.224,0.854,0.482,0\" alt=\"photograph of a five story large building shaped like a wedge\" image=\"/loc/seattle/seattle-hotel.png\"/>\n<Comic alt=\"illustration of an old-timey man with high cheekbones\" caption=\"Arthur Denny, believer of the 'Seattle streets should follow the coastline' system\" overlap={150} speechBubbles={[{ text: 'But it’s cursed! how many hotels stood here before?' }]} image=\"/comics/sinking-ship/g2.png\" absoluteHeight={60}/>\n<Comic speechBubbles={[{ text: '...' },{text:\"Three...\"}]} position=\"right\"/>\n<Comic speechBubbles={[{ text: 'And how many got taken out by disasters?' }]} position=\"left\"/>\n<Comic speechBubbles={[{ text: '...two...' }]} position=\"right\"/>\n<Comic speechBubbles={[{ text: 'And tell me, how many hotels are standing there now?' }]} position=\"left\"/>\n<Comic speechBubbles={[{ text: 'none :(' }]} position=\"right\"/>\n<LOCItem linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn86071999/1949-04-16/ed-1/?sp=1\" alt=\"newspaper - The Northwest Times - with image of Hotel Seattle\" image=\"/loc/hotel-earthquake.png\" caption=\"April 16, 1949\"/>\n\nThe Occidental II was burned down by the Great Seattle Fire, only 4 years after it had been built to replace the Occidental I.\n\nThe Hotel Seattle, which was built to replace it, was also unlucky -- in 1949, when a huge earthquake shook Olympia, many buildings in Pioneer Square also got damaged.

The Olmsted firm, who designed Central Park in New York, designed many of Seattle’s most iconic parks, including Volunteer Park, Seward Park, Woodland Park, and the Arboretum.\n\nWhen the Olmsted firm was making its grand plan for the city, they also did a review of Ravenna Park, which at the time was privately owned by William and Louise Beck.\n\n<Comic position=\"full\" image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree1.png\"/>\n\nRavenna Park was notable for two things:\n\n- Its deep ravine, which was formed by the Vashon Glacier and was fed by other lakes that were glacier carved as well, including Bitter Lake, Green Lake, and Haller Lake.\n- Its large, large, LARGE trees, who avoided being cut down by loggers.\n\nJohn Charles Olmsted recommended that Ravenna Park be bought by the city because of these two reasons, and stated that the forest was better preserved than any other portion of the city. \n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree2.png\" caption=\"Louise Beck\" position=\"right\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"These trees are beautiful giants who deserve beautiful names. \"},{text:\"I’ll name this one Paderewski, because I think these royal trees would certainly appreciate classical music.\"}, {text:\" Plus Jan Paderewski is going to play a recital in Seattle next week. \"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree3.png\" position=\"center\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"and this one should be called Roosevelt, because it is awesome, just like our president.\"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree4.png\" position=\"left\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"I’ll call this one Adam.

Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing. Roosevelt, the so-called Largest Fir Tree in the State, was the first to be cut down, which alarmed many people.\n\nWilliam Beck tried to investigate: the Parks Board said that the trees were rotted and a danger. However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\n\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them. Now, none of the original named trees stand in Ravenna Park today. \n\nMost future trees are now protected by <a href=\"https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.11TRPR_25.11.050GEPRRETRCA\">Seattle Municipal code</a>, which characterizes trees based on their size, species, age, and heritage. But the *Roosevelt* tree would still not be protected, since tree removals by the Parks department are not watched under this code and just rely on the departments policy.\n{/* <Comic image=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" position=\"left\" speechBubbles={[{}]}/>*/}\n","title":"Disappearing Trees in Ravenna Park","location":["Seattle"],"latlon":[47.67253514142577,-122.30892713366536],"zoom":14,"tags":["parks","olmsted"],"cardImage":"/placeholderThumbnail.png","stickers":[{"image":"/placeholderThumbnail.png"},{"image":"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree1.png"},{"image":"/loc/seattle/ravenna/letter2.png","linkOut":"https://www.loc.gov/resource/mss52571.mss52571-02-096_0293_0296/?sp=3&st=image&r=0.323,0.009,0.293,0.436,0"}]}]},{"tag":"bridges","posts":[{"slug":"joseprizal","content":"# Dr. Jose P Rizal Bridge\n\nSeattle is a hilly city -- its land was carved from glaciers in the\nPleistocene ice age.\n\n  <Comic position=\"full\" image=\"/comics/jose-p-rizal/glacier.png\" speechBubbles={[]}/>\n  \nThe Capitol Hill - First Hill - Beacon Hill ridge was carved from this\nglacier.
