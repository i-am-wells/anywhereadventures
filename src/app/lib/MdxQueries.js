The technology of the day was to shoot water at the hills and take the wet clay and dump it into Elliot Bay.\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/regrade-results.jpg\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/2024693820/\" caption=\"The Washington Hotel, where Theodore Roosevelt stayed when he visited Seattle\"/>\n\n<Comic position={\"left\"} speechBubbles={[{ text: \"It was a lot of work, but at least we made a beautiful capitol.\" }]} image=\"/TR.png\"/>\n<Comic position={\"right\"} speechBubbles={[]} image=\"/TR.png\"/>\n<Comic position={\"left\"} speechBubbles={[{ text: \"... what?\" }]} image=\"/TR.png\"/>",

That's why it's harder to traverse east-west in the city: *you're\ngoing against the glacier's path*.\n\nIn the early 1900s, city engineer R.H. Thompson was trying to make Seattle\nmore easily traversable by tearing through some of these hills. The 12th Ave\nS Bridge was built in 1911 to carry traffic over the canyon that was carved.\n\nIn 1974, this bridge was renamed to the Dr. Jose P. Rizal Bridge, due to the\nefforts of Seattle Filipino Americans Trinidad Rojo and Vic Bacho.\n<Comic position=\"full\" image=\"/comics/jose-p-rizal/rojo-bacho.png\" speechBubbles={[]}/>\n\n<LOCItem image=\"/loc/joseprizal.jpg\" caption=\"Page from the Filipino Forum, a newspaper for Seattle's Filipino community\" linkOut=\"\"  assetLink=\"https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:ndnp:wa:batch_wa_canvasback_ver02:data:sn88085780:00211107650:1961061601:1115/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg#h=682&w=442\"/>\n\nYou can learn more about Dr. Rizal [here](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2024/02/remembering-jose-rizal-filipino-revolutionary/).",

This led to the Hotel Seattle fall into disrepair, and it was the first building to get torn down in a larger plan to renovate Pioneer Square.\n\nIf a building in Pioneer Square is still standing that was around for the 1949 earthquake, you can probably find signs of earthquake damage.\n\n<LOCItem lcLink=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/75696663/\" image=\"/loc/triangle.jpg\" caption=\"Map of Seattle in 1891\"/>\n \n{/* {scheme}://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}/{region}/{size}/{rotation}/{quality}.{format} */}",
