The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\n\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\" alt=\"Illustrated map of the Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. \" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\n\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business.

However, aware of its history, the decision was made to preserve the building by moving it to a new location.\n\n<ComicSection cols=\"6\" rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\n\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/hall.png\", position:{col:1, row:2}, size:{width:6, height:4}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"We should move it along 15th, it's way easier\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:2}, style:{outline: \"bubble\"}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"But it's too tall - we've have to move the bridge.

The first reason being that it was not heavy enough. The building was estimated to be over 400,000 pounds, and so it was placed on 28 dollies to spread the work around.\n\n<ComicSection cols={8} rowHeight=\"2rem\" elements={[\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/wheelGang.png\", position:{col:1, row:4}, size:{width:8, height:6}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"Alright, team!!

Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing. Roosevelt, the so-called Largest Fir Tree in the State, was the first to be cut down, which alarmed many people.\n\nWilliam Beck tried to investigate: the Parks Board said that the trees were rotted and a danger. However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\n\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them.

The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\n\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\" alt=\"Illustrated map of the Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. \" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\n\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business.

The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\n\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\" alt=\"Illustrated map of the Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. \" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\n\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business.

The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\n\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\" alt=\"Illustrated map of the Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. \" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\n\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business. With its wooden architecture, it stood out like a sore thumb compared to the other stucco-clad buildings of the A-Y-P.\" alt=\"photograph of building with exposed wood on outside.\" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/hoo.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.wa0056.photos/?sp=3\"/>\n\nIn 2008, the university wanted to build its new molecular engineering building on the site of Cunningham Hall. However, aware of its history, the decision was made to preserve the building by moving it to a new location.\n\n<ComicSection cols=\"6\" rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\n\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/hall.png\", position:{col:1, row:2}, size:{width:6, height:4}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"We should move it along 15th, it's way easier\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:2}, style:{outline: \"bubble\"}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"But it's too tall - we've have to move the bridge.

The first reason being that it was not heavy enough. The building was estimated to be over 400,000 pounds, and so it was placed on 28 dollies to spread the work around.\n\n<ComicSection cols={8} rowHeight=\"2rem\" elements={[\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/wheelGang.png\", position:{col:1, row:4}, size:{width:8, height:6}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"Alright, team!!

Despite all the (metaphorical) roadblocks, the 100 year old two-story building was moved .3 to its new home! \n\n{/* <ComicSection elements={[\n\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:1, height:1}, style:{outline: \"bubble\"}, bubbleStyle: {tailDegree: 0}},\n\n]}/>  */}\n",

This led to the Hotel Seattle fall into disrepair, and it was the first building to get torn down in a larger plan to renovate Pioneer Square.\n\nIf a building in Pioneer Square is still standing that was around for the 1949 earthquake, you can probably find signs of earthquake damage.\n\n<LOCItem linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/mss11049.mss11049-001_00683_00886/?sp=159\" alt=\"two page spread of a notebook with cursive\" image=\"/loc/susan-journal.png\" caption=\"Page from Susan B.

The 12th Ave\nS Bridge was built in 1911 to carry traffic over the canyon that was carved.\n\nIn 1974, this bridge was renamed to the Dr. Jose P.

The Olmsted firm, who designed Central Park in New York, designed many of Seattle’s most iconic parks, including Volunteer Park, Seward Park, Woodland Park, and the Arboretum.\n\nWhen the Olmsted firm was making its grand plan for the city, they also did a review of Ravenna Park, which at the time was privately owned by William and Louise Beck.\n\n<Comic position=\"full\" image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree1.png\"/>\n\nRavenna Park was notable for two things:\n\n- Its deep ravine, which was formed by the Vashon Glacier and was fed by other lakes that were glacier carved as well, including Bitter Lake, Green Lake, and Haller Lake.\n- Its large, large, LARGE trees, who avoided being cut down by loggers.\n\nJohn Charles Olmsted recommended that Ravenna Park be bought by the city because of these two reasons, and stated that the forest was better preserved than any other portion of the city. \n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree2.png\" caption=\"Louise Beck\" position=\"right\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"These trees are beautiful giants who deserve beautiful names. \"},{text:\"I’ll name this one Paderewski, because I think these royal trees would certainly appreciate classical music.\"}, {text:\" Plus Jan Paderewski is going to play a recital in Seattle next week. \"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree3.png\" position=\"center\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"and this one should be called Roosevelt, because it is awesome, just like our president.\"}]}/>\n\n<Comic image=\"/comics/ravenna-tree/ravennaTree4.png\" position=\"left\" size=\"L\" speechBubbles={[{text:\"I’ll call this one Adam.

Soon after, the large trees, the stars of the park, started mysteriously disappearing. Roosevelt, the so-called Largest Fir Tree in the State, was the first to be cut down, which alarmed many people.\n\nWilliam Beck tried to investigate: the Parks Board said that the trees were rotted and a danger. However, only a few years earlier the trees were evaluated to be healthy.\n\nThe trees continued to be cut down with no explanation with what was wrong with them. Now, none of the original named trees stand in Ravenna Park today. \n\nMost future trees are now protected by <a href=\"https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.11TRPR_25.11.050GEPRRETRCA\">Seattle Municipal code</a>, which characterizes trees based on their size, species, age, and heritage. But the *Roosevelt* tree would still not be protected, since tree removals by the Parks department are not watched under this code and just rely on the departments policy.\n{/* <Comic image=\"/placeholderThumbnail.png\" position=\"left\" speechBubbles={[{}]}/>*/}\n",

The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\n\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\" alt=\"Illustrated map of the Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. \" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\n\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business.

However, aware of its history, the decision was made to preserve the building by moving it to a new location.\n\n<ComicSection cols=\"6\" rowHeight=\"3rem\" elements={[\n\n    {type:\"image\", src:\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/hall.png\", position:{col:1, row:2}, size:{width:6, height:4}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"We should move it along 15th, it's way easier\", position:{col:1, row:1}, size:{width:3, height:2}, style:{outline: \"bubble\"}},\n    {type:\"text\", src:\"But it's too tall - we've have to move the bridge.

The first reason being that it was not heavy enough.

The A-Y-P was built on the new University of Washington campus, which at the time had only *three* buildings constructed.\n\nTo create a fair that would rival Portland’s, Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the layout of the fair. The Olmsted Brothers firm, familiar with Seattle from designing the city’s park system, chose to feature Mount Rainier as the centerpiece of the fairgrounds. Rainier Vista still exists on the university’s campus with the fountain and pathway pointing at the mountain.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\" alt=\"Illustrated map of the Authorized birds eye view of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. \" image=\"/loc/seattle/cunninghamHall/bigMap.png\" linkOut=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4284s.ct011997/?r=-0.403,0.311,1.133,0.777,0\"/>\n\nCunningham Hall was designed by architects were Saunders and Lawton, whose partnership designed many buildings around Seattle, including the old Beacon Hill Elementary School and the Alaska Building in Pioneer Square. They also designed the Hoo Hoo House for the AYP.\n\n<LOCItem caption=\"The Hoo Hoo House was built for and by the Hoo Hoo Club which was a fraternity for people in the lumber business.
