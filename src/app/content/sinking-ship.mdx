# Sinking Ship

<LOCItem linkOut="https://www.loc.gov/item/75696663/" image="/loc/triangle.jpg" caption="Map of Seattle in 1891"/>

Here, where Yesler, 1st, and James meet, a triangle piece of land hosts a unique parking garage called the “Sinking Ship”.

Before this parking garage was built here, it was the site of three Seattle hotels: the Occidental I, the Occidental II, and the Hotel Seattle.

The Occidental II was burned down by the Great Seattle Fire, only 4 years after it had been built to replace the Occidental I.

The Hotel Seattle, which was built to replace it, was also unlucky -- in 1949, when a huge earthquake shook Olympia, many buildings in Pioneer Square also got damaged. This led to the Hotel Seattle fall into disrepair, and it was the first building to get torn down in a larger plan to renovate Pioneer Square.

If a building in Pioneer Square is still standing that was around for the 1949 earthquake, you can probably find signs of earthquake damage.

 The parking garage that sits here today takes advantage of the unique shape of the land, as well as its grading along a hill.
