# The Denny Regrades

When Arthur Denny lived in Seattle, he lived on a hill named after himself -- Denny Hill.

Denny imagined that Seattle would be the capitol of the state of Washington with the center of town being in what is now Belltown.

He wanted to make it easier to access by horse, so the big regrade of Seattle started. The technology of the day was to shoot water at the hills and take the wet clay and dump it into Elliot Bay.
