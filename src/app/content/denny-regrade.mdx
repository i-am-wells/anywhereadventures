# The Denny Regrades

When Arthur Denny lived in Seattle, he lived on a hill named after himself -- Denny Hill.

Denny imagined that Seattle would be the capitol of the state of Washington with the center of town being in what is now Belltown.

City engineer Arthur H. Dimmock wanted to make it easier to access by horse, so the big regrade of Seattle started. The technology of the day was to shoot water at the hills and take the wet clay and dump it into Elliot Bay.

The water was pumped from Lake Union - over *20,000 gallons* of water were used to cut down about 27 city blocks.
