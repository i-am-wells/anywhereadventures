The Medgar Evers pool was funded in part by the federal Model Cities program, which aimed to provide more equitable recreation and athletic activities in cities across the United States. Seattle applied for the federal grant to create better infrastructure for its International District, Pioneer Square, and Central Area neighborhoods.

Built in the historically Black neighborhood of the Central Area, it was through a community petition that the pool be named in memory of Evers, who had been assassinated only a few years earlier in Mississippi.

At the time, Seattle was also examining its own discriminatory practices. In the wake of MLK’s assassination, Seattle passed Ordinance 96619 to prohibit covenants and sundown zones in the city. 

Seattle has a large Black community, with three large migrations of folks coming to the city in hopes of a good life. This dream was heavily championed by Horace R. Cayton Sr., a journalist and eventual creator of the Seattle Republican, which, of Seattle’s seven African American newspapers, was the most successful and was published from 1894 until 1915.
