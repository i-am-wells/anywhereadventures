Historic buildings can be seen all around the world, but Seattle is special because it also has a fleet of treasured historic boats. These boats, floating at Lake Union Park’s Historic Ship Wharf, are the collection of some of Seattle’s most impressive “-est”-es:

The *Arthur Foss* held many jobs. It started off in Astoria, Oregon, navigating the dangerous mouth of the Columbia River where it dumps into the Pacific Ocean. Dubbed the “graveyard of the Pacific”, the Arthur Foss, then known as Wallowa, would act as an experience guide and tow boats across the crossing.
