Born in 1900 on Bainbridge Island, Kichio Allen Arai was a Japanese American architect who was the first Asian American to create work under his own name in Seattle.

His family moved to Seattle when he was 10 years old, and he graduated from Broadway High School (which is the current site of Seattle Central College) and later the University of Washington with a bachelor’s in architecture. He left Seattle to study architecture at Harvard - at that time, he was most well known for being a semi-professional baseball players as a center-fielder in the Seattle Asahi Club.

Arai’s structures in Seattle are very recognizable:

He created current building for the Seattle Betsuin Buddhist Temple, after the first one designed by Saunders & Lawton was torn down.
He also created the first Torii gate that was gifted to Seward Park in 1934 after being created for the Seattle Potlatch Festival. In the 1980s, the torii was removed because of decomposition, but a new gate was installed in 2022.

One of his other original structures remains standing, not very far from the temple! In 1934, he designed the permanent home for the Seattle Dojo, which is the oldest judo dojo in the contiguous United States.

Before they had a building, Seattle Dojo would operate out of basements throughout Japantown.

Even though it’s been well over 50 years, Arai’s work has endured -- The Seattle Dojo is still in use as a judo dojo, and the Seattle Betsuin Buddhist Temple is still an active Buddhist church.

The Seattle Betsuin Buddhist Temple was the last project Arai completed before being forcibly interned at Minidoka in Idaho.
