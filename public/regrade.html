    The Washington Hotel used to sit on top of Denny Hill and sat where the
    Josephium is now. It was destroyed during the big regrading of Seattle, led
    by city engineer R.H. Thomson, which flattened Jackson street, lowered Denny
    Hill into what is now Belltown, and cut through the Captiol Hill-First
    Hill-Beacon Hill ridge.

    If you look at the Cornelius, you can imagine what Denny Hill used to be:
    the top of the building is where the top of the hill used to reach.
